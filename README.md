## What is it?

This small application is a project developed for university that involves learning how the DirectX 11 render pipeline works and how to implement various lighting techniques.

Specifically, the following featuers have been implemented:

- Reading from YAML to add materials, cameras, scenery, and other settings without recompiling.
- Phong shading, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
- Materials include albedo and specular map textures with lighting interaction.
- Point and Directional lights that use Phong shading, configurable via YAML.
- A free camera and normal camera, switchable using the number keys.
- Pixel colour blending for translucent objects

I am currently working on skyboxes, and potentially even basic heightmap terrain generation if time permits.
